# About BanSync
BanSync is one of the primary features of Xenia Bot. It's intended purpose is to warn other server moderators about dangerous and/or problematic people that may cause issues in your server.

## How does it work?
Once you have requested BanSync to be enabled on your server (and it's been approved by our review team), all of the members that are banned in your server will be uploaded to Xenia's Database. When this happens Xenia will store in each ban record; who was banned, why they were banned, what server they were banned in, and when they were banned.

Once this is recorded in Xenia's database, it will notify the moderators in all servers that Xenia shares with that banned user, but only if that server has the BanSync feature enabled.
