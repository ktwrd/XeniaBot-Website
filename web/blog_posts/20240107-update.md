Happy (late) New Year! An update has been released for Xenia, small changes and fixes.
- Xenia Dashboard has been bumped to `v0.8`
- Xenia Bot has been bumped to `v1.10`

## Additions
- Role Preserving
    * When someone leaves your server, then re-joins it, they will be granted all the roles that they previously had.
    * This can be enabled via `/rolepreserve enable` or via the Dashboard in the Moderation tab.

- Guilds will be notified when their BanSync Guild State has been modified by a team member. ([9a0a998](https://github.com/ktwrd/XeniaBot/commit/9a0a99880140e875fa18e794a7068612a162e031))
- Error Reporting is now more easily accessible for the Dashboard. You can now report exceptions with the `ErrorReportController` which is available in the `XeniaBot.Shared` project.

## Changes
- `ConfigData` has gone through a major refactor. When `LOG_WRITE` is set to `true`, it will automatically upgrade the config schema. This upgrade is incompatible with environment configs, so you'll have to manually upgrade that yourself.
- Removed the `/bansync enableguild` command since `/bansync setstate` does the same thing but better.
- Upgraded to .NET 8 ([18f4be8](https://github.com/ktwrd/XeniaBot/commit/18f4be8215f781d7cfb614a5dbe935f00f99a8a1))
    * Default URL for the Dashboard has changed from `80` to `8080`.
- Navbar was moved to it's own component in the dashboard
- When `LOG_WRITE` is `true`, it will try to write the config after parsing, reading and validating it. ([fddbb98](https://github.com/ktwrd/XeniaBot/commit/fddbb9890ea9e6d0420eb9ef1e2294d6fc8072a4))
