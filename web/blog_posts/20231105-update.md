A major security patch for Xenia has been released.

## Security Issues Fixed
- Any user (that has access to Server Settings) could force changes in the Admin Server Settings ([57a4089](https://github.com/ktwrd/XeniaBot/commit/57a4089f90bac1824dcaed859edc5a5653c64faf))
    * Added override functions if someone in the future makes the same mistake ([18c03e8](https://github.com/ktwrd/XeniaBot/commit/0f5f2c6f7cd8cb248a55c2f62b475d05749fab69))
- UserWhitelist config field would be ignored when using commands protected with `RequireUserWhitelistAttribute` ([0f5f2c6](https://github.com/ktwrd/XeniaBot/commit/0f5f2c6f7cd8cb248a55c2f62b475d05749fab69))
    * Note: RequireUserWhitelistAttribute was removed in that same commit.
