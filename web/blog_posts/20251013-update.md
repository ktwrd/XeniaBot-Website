Quick bug fix was released. "Message Delete" log events should now be properly sent.

I've gained some motivation to work on Xenia again, which is lovely, but this might not last long. Work has been pretty hectic, along with the work I'm doing for [Open Fortress](https://openfortress.fun), so expect delays with future releases and bug fixes.

Some work has been made on the rewrite that's being done, and the the schema drift issues (in MongoDB) have been mostly resolved for The Big Database Migration™.

*p.s;* sorry for the lack of updates, life & work has been hectic!
