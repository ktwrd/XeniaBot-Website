How fancy is this! A new Xenia update, *with* a Quality of Life update and preparing for a codebase refactor???

Finally built up the energy to work on Xenia again after starting my new job, and I was a little bit annoyed with the current method for keeping track of warns in the [/r/LapfoxTrax Discord Server](https://discord.gg/lapfox). So I offered to implement a strike-based system into the existing Warn system, and my offer was accepted!

You can view more about the Warn System in [the updated guide page](/guide/about_warns).

# Changes

Along with the QoL changes, this release also starts preparing for a big-ish change with how the `_id` property in the Database is stored for all documents. Silly me decided to use an `ObjectId` as the type (which I hate working with), instead of something that is easier to keep track of (like a `Guid` or a randomly-generated string). To know when the code should replace all values for `_id` with a freshly created `Guid`, a new collection has been added to keep track of the previous version that was launched. To see how it actually works, you can take a peek at the [code here](https://github.com/ktwrd/XeniaBot/blob/4f990d028fd3d0ce6d885a559f37f1f496ffa180/XeniaBot.Data/Services/XeniaVersionService.cs).
