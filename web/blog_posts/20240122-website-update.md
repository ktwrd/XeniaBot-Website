# Website Redesign

I made a twitter poll a few days ago asking what I should do (in relation to Xenia) and the most voted option was to make the website better, which is what I did! I decided to re-write the Xenia website in PHP since I've been playing around with that more since dropping Vue.js support on my personal website, which was adding unnecessary bloat to it.

We now have a Guide section to help server owners setup Xenia with some assistance and to help them understand Xenia's functions (which can be hard to explain at times, to every server owner that contacts me).

I've also re-written the Blog system to be more in-line with [my personal website](https://kate.pet/p/blog).

If you wish, you can view the codebase [here](https://github.com/ktwrd/XeniaBot-Website) and you can chime-in for discussion relating to Xenia on [my discord server](https://kate.pet/l/discord).
