Holy moly! A new update has been released for Xenia Bot. Some bug fixes, and implementing HTMX into the Dashboard.

Yep, you heard me right, HTMX has now been (pretty much) implemented *everywhere* in the Dashboard! This has been a somewhat big milestone for me and the Dashboard since;
1. First time creating a reactive web app.
2. Actually using HTMX in something that isn't a to-do list.

## Additions
- HTMX for the Dashboard
- When trying to access a page that requires you to login, Discord will now redirect you *back* to the page you came from.

## Changes
- Admin Panel
  - Admin Panel Server Listing
    - Implemented infinite scrolling with HTMX
  - Layout has not changed, but the page will no longer refresh when saving a setting.
- Server Listing
  - Implemented infinite scrolling with HTMX
  - Server Details
    - "Fun" card now shows what modules are enabled and disabled.
    - "Fun" settings
      - Confession, Counting, and Level System settings have been moved back to one page.
      - The page will no longer reload when saving any settings due to full HTMX implementation on this page.
- Reminders
  - Implemented infinite scrolling with HTMX
- Preferences
  - Uses HTMX for saving your own preferences.

## Bug Fixes
