It's been a long time since we last had an update!

Xenia for Discord v1.2 was released today with some minor bug fixes, quality of life changes, new features, and a rebrand!

Xenia for Discord is also Open-Source now! You can view the code [in our GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ktwrd/XeniaBot). All issues will also be handled through there, so please create them there instead of the old repository.

## Additions
- [Level System]
  - Added the `/xp leaderboard` to view your server's leaderboard
- Image Manipulation
  - Added the `/caption` command. Backported from "Xenia for Discord"
- Economy
  - Two commands have been added; `/econ daily` and `/econ balance`. Currently there is no way to spend your coins, but there will be in the near future.
- Add `/dice` command.
- Add `/remind` command.

## Changes
- The Leveling system has had the following refactors since v1.1
  - Each level is now `xpRequired = level^2 * 100`
  - You'll now get in-between 4 to 16 experience per message instead of 1-5 experience.
- Minor spelling mistakes in code and messages.
- `/esix query` will show `e621.net` for NSFW posts instead of `e926.net`

## Removals
- Branding related to "SkidBot." See: [Explanation](https://xenia.kate.pet/posts/revolt-edition-update/)
